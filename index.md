## Setup
This experiment is meant to get you set up with the data aquisition system. It uses the arduino accelerometer module to track you as you move the arduino around. Later on, this data can be read from the arduino SD card into a computer for post-processing.

## Setting up the Arduino

Use the [guide][1] from the Arduino website to get the Arduino set up with your computer. 

## Arduino Code

The full coode to use can be found in the repository under this [link](). Here is how the code was written

```C
int x = 2; 
int y = x + 7; 

```

## Procedure

Run your code and then walk around with the arduino for a while to collect data. After collecting your data, turn off the arduino and remove the SD Card. Insert the SD card into your computer. 

## Data 

Here is a file containing some sample data that you can compare to your own. This was collected from walking around with the arduino board. Compare your file to this one to ensure that the data has been formatted correctly.  

## Setting up the Python 

Use this [tutorial][2] to set up Python on your machine. 

## Data Processing

The data processing python file is provided in the repository. Provided here are some of the outputs when the data is plotted.
